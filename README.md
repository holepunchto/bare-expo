# Bare on Expo

Example of embedding Bare in an Expo application using <https://github.com/holepunchto/react-native-bare-kit>.

## Usage

Start by installing the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

When finished, you can run the app on either iOS or Android.

### iOS

```sh
npm run ios
```

### Android

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may experience problems running the app on an emulated Android device under QEMU due to https://github.com/holepunchto/libjs/issues/4. If you encounter crashes, try running the app on a real Android device instead.

```sh
npm run android
```
